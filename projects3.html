							<h4>DIY Study Abroad</h4>
							<p>This is a <b><a href="https://diystudyabroadblog.wordpress.com/">website</a></b> I started in 2016 to help high school students apply to colleges in the U.S. by themselves. Written in traditional Chinese, the project aims to help those who are talented but perhaps do not have as many resources as others. I faced similar challenges as a high school senior attending a public high school when less than 2 students study abroad in the US annnually and the teachers do not have experiences whatsoever. Since the establishment, there has been 40k+ views and 20k+ visitors and I receive comments from people who find it helpful.

							<h4>Paper in Political Science</h4>
							<p><b>The Government’s Role in Economic Development and an Alternative Proposal to Achieve Rapid Growth in Developing Countries </b><br>
							The paper aims to assess the role of government in economic development through the implementation of industrial policies and market interventions. I argue that policies that focus on paced market liberalization in selective industries and attract foreign direct investment to build capacities are most conducive to economic development. I support my view by analyzing historical cases in East Asia, Latin America, Russia, and elsewhere. My conclusions challenge the neoliberal consensus that government regulation slows down economic growth.

							<h4>Computer Vision</h4>
							<p><b>A Optical Character Recognition System with Pattern Editing Functionalities</b><br>
							An Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system that allows text segmentation, text editing (duplication, replacement, and removal), and text recognition in a scanned document containing either printed or handwritten texts. The system utilizes Python OpenCV2 module for text segmentation, Pytorch neural network module for text recognition, EMNIST dataset for network training, and achieves an overall 89% accuracy rate.
